# The Kitchen Inventory

An application to keep track of what items you have in the cupboard, with a shopping list to keep track of what needs buying. The 'home' and 'basket' buttons can be used to add items to the 'In The Cupboard' or 'Shopping List' sections respectively, and then elements of the lists can either be removed or (in the case of shopping list items) added to the 'In The Cupboard' list. Animations on both 'delete' and 'move-to-cupboard' events.
